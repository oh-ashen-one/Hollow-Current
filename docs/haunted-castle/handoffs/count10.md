# HANDOFF: piece 0 (integrator), Haunted Castle map plumbing

Branch `haunted-castle` in `/Users/midir/hollow-current-haunted-castle` (main clone, pushed to origin). Model: Opus 5.5. Date 2026-10-13.
Merged pieces: hc/forge `ec2c7fa`, hc/props `6d24e03`, hc/audio `d1ddd9b`, hc/count `2a8c23a`, hc/layout `136b002`, hc/art `714ffe2` (round 2). Each piece's own handoff is archived in `docs/haunted-castle/handoffs/<piece>.md`.

## Verified (how)
- `python3 tools/check_source.py`: PASS 388 rules assertions; runtime C# compiles against the macOS player and editor assemblies (now recursive: `Runtime/Castle/` is compiled).
- Unity 6000.3.20f1, one instance at a time, every run through `~/.cache/gpu-slot/bin/gpu_slot.sh capture --label hc-integrator` (logs `/Users/midir/hollow-current-haunted-castle/.*.log`, gitignored):
  - `CountClaudeImport.Prepare` (nographics): HC_COUNTCLAUDE_PASS, 6 clips, 28 bones, prefab `Resources/Characters/CountClaude.prefab`.
  - `NativeBuild.ValidateCastleGeometry` (nographics): HC_CASTLE_GEOMETRY_PASS, 9 contract points reachable from the gatehouse (crypt, reliquary, tower orrery, portrait closet), HC_CASTLE_HUNTER_PASS.
  - `HouseLighting.PrepareAndBakeCastle` (graphics, batchmode): 4 lightmaps, 188 probes, 17 reflections; receipt `Art/LayoutData/CastleBake.json`.
  - `NativeBuild.BuildPreparedMacCastle`: Succeeded, `Builds/macOS-Castle/Hollow Current Castle.app`. Headless player boot (`-batchmode -nographics`, then SIGTERM): HC_AUDIO_READY 75 clips, HC_READY, HC_STARTUP_READY, no exceptions; only `HC_MISSING_ART speech voice_cc_arrival`.
  - Bellwether receipt was stale from the shared-source changes (BuildPreparedMac refused, loud message). Re-ran `PrepareAndBake`: same counts as shipped (4 / 124 / 9). `BuildPreparedMac` passed all geometry checks and built; headless boot HC_STARTUP_READY, 49 clips.
  - `NativeBuild.BuildPreparedMacAll`: both maps in `Builds/macOS/Hollow Current.app` (Succeeded, ~899 MB).
- Not verified: anything rendered or played (no captures, no input-driven run of the picker, map switch, forge, fight, stair loop or drawbridge). The critic/playtest owns that.

## What exists (signatures other pieces code against)
- `Core/MapId.cs`: `enum MapId { Bellwether, Castle }`; `MapCatalog.Get(MapId)` -> `MapInfo{SceneName, ScenePath, BakeReceiptPath, LightingSettingsPath, LayoutFolder, DisplayName, HunterName}`; `TryParse`, `TryFromSceneName`, `FromPreference`; PlayerPrefs key `hc.map`.
- `Core/CaseBook.cs`: every per-map word (evidence names/ids, instrument names, note titles/ids/art, journal choices, dispatch/goal text, kill ending, relic text). `CaseBook.For(map)`. Correct journal answer uses the same enum slots for both maps (chapel bell = `AnchorKind.MusicBox`). Castle note titles `Ledger: the steward / the astronomer / the painter` with ids `cc_ledger_steward/orrery/portrait` (= `LedgerHints`).
- `Core/Investigation.cs`: `new Investigation(CaseBook)`; `WinByKill()`, `HunterSlain`.
- `Runtime/World.cs`: `Build(MapId)`, `LoadOrBuild(MapId)`, `Map`, instance `Spawn`, `HunterSpawn`, `AnchorFloor`, `PerchPoints`, `IsInside/IsSafe`, `CheckpointPosition`, `StepSurface`, `NavBounds`, `Castle` (`World.CastleSpots`, serializable copy of `CastleWorld.Points`), `CastleRoutePoints()`. Castle: CastleWorld's own NavMesh is removed and rebuilt by `World.BuildNavigation` (castle skips trigger colliders, includes MeshColliders); missing kit/winch/bell/brazier/altar/relic/ledger interactables are added as fallbacks.
- `Runtime/HunterProfile.cs`: plain class, defaults = Split Grin; `SplitGrinProfile`; `HunterProfile.For(map)`; virtual `OnStagger(Presence)`, `OnDeath(Presence)`. `Presence.Profile`, `Presence.Stagger()`, `Presence.Defeat()`.
- `Runtime/CastleRun.cs` (castle only, `Game.Castle`): owns `Forge`, `Fight`; altar hold -> `Forge.Tick` (Craft only via tick), strike = instrument button within 3.2 m / 55 deg during a hunt, `Fight.Killed` -> `Defeat` + `WinByKill`; props on CastleWorld anchors; AUDIO.md loops/one-shots.
- `Runtime/MissingArt.cs`: castle-only magenta/silent placeholders (`MissingArt.Placeholders`), logged as `HC_MISSING_ART`.
- `InteractKind` gained `Relic`, `Altar` (appended); `Interactable.RelicIndex`.
- Editor entry points and receipt policy: README "Maps" table.

## What each piece does next
- Piece 2 (hc/art): merge takes your `Runtime/Castle/CastleArt.cs` over the layout stub (same `Place(string,Transform,Vector3,Quaternion)`). Commit `.meta` files for new assets (`CastleArt.cs.meta` already exists on haunted-castle: keep guid `git show haunted-castle:Assets/HollowCurrent/Runtime/Castle/CastleArt.cs.meta` or expect a meta conflict). Optional textures: `Resources/Castle/ClawScores`, `Resources/Castle/Ledger{Steward,Astronomer,Painter}`, `Resources/UI/BloodLedger/{Dialogue,Warning,Panel}` (currently magenta).
- Piece 4b (Count behaviour): edit `Runtime/Castle/CountClaudeProfile.cs` (now a `HunterProfile` subclass with your values) and override `OnStagger/OnDeath`; perch/glide/dive needs new hooks in `Presence.cs` (piece 0 file): send requests. Read `Game.Castle.Fight` for `SpeedMultiplier/Retreating`.
- Piece 6: add `voice_cc_arrival`, `voice_cc_kit`, `voice_cc_warning`, `voice_cc_return`, `voice_cc_contain`, `voice_cc_ending`, `voice_cc_hint_signal/trace/voice` (castle `Speak(id)` looks up `voice_cc_<id>`; `cc_*` ids as given).
- Piece 1: notes you place are extra flavour unless titled as in `CaseBook.Castle.NoteTitles`; fallbacks currently sit near Compass/Voice/Altar points.
- Every builder: after a shared-file change both receipts go stale; re-run the map's `PrepareAndBake*` before a prepared build.

## Round 2 (integrator)
- Relic gating: silver blade = the reliquary box (trigger around the box art), shut until the grave-ash lantern is held on its claw-scores for 1 s; hilt at the orrery asset's socket (manifest notes.socket, assumes Blender x,y,z -> Unity x,z,y); moonstone on the pedestal behind the portrait door. Ledger pages speak the matching relic hint.
- Far-bank escape: after the bell seal, once the drawbridge has lowered, entering `DrawbridgeTrigger` = `FinishAtVan`.
- Doors: with the 1.5 m probe 17/23 castle doors could not open (0 degrees) and the rest stopped at 55. `Door.FitProbe` + hinge moved to the clearer wall face: all 23 open 80-175 degrees (`ValidateCastleGeometry` threshold 75 for the castle; Bellwether unchanged at 85).
- Count sources moved to `Art/Characters/CountClaude`; castle `Speak("arrival")` -> `voice_cc_night` (also warning -> `cc_hunt_hungry`, return -> `cc_stay`).
- Sky + moons wired (`CastleArt.ApplySkybox`, moons along `Pale/RedMoonDirection`, baked). `ImportYaw` left at 0.
- Capture mode `-hc-capture <dir>` (`Runtime/Castle/CaptureMode.cs`); round 1 notes `docs/haunted-castle/rounds/r1/NOTES.md`.
- Builds: `Builds/macOS-Castle/Hollow Current Castle.app`, `Builds/macOS/Hollow Current.app` (both maps); both boot headless.

## Open issues
- `tools/audit_project.py` fails on its first, pre-existing check (`com.unity.inputsystem` is not a built-in package); the new scene checks pass when that loop is skipped.
- `CastleDrawbridge` moved from `CastleWorld.cs` to its own file (Unity scene-serialization requirement); hc/layout edits must follow.
- Relic gating, the far-bank escape and the forge/fight are compiled and engine-validated for reachability only; not input-playtested.
- No Blood Ledger UI art (`Resources/UI/BloodLedger/*`) or ledger page art: magenta placeholders in the castle UI.
- `GiantSkeleton` and other extra art (`BanquetTable`, `Banner`, ...) are not placed by the layout.
- Not yet run: any rendered capture or input playtest of either map.

# Piece 4j — Count Claude round 10, live hunt AI (branch `hc/count10`, Opus 5.5)

`check_source.py` PASS; Unity not launched; no import needed (Presence and profile only).

## Root cause (from `.playtest-escape.log` / `.playtest-kill.log`)
- **Escape run:** the investigator was hidden in the wardrobe with the torch off from before the hunt until it ended. By design
  `CountSees()` is false then, and the Count started every hunt with `Memory.Clear()` and only a perch-to-perch route. He had
  no knowledge of her and never went to her area, so no dive was possible. (The Bellwether hunter covers rooms; the Count only
  hopped perches.)
- **Kill run:** the driver struck him at the instant each hunt or retreat began (hits at 36.3, 58.8 and 83.4 s), leaving no
  window for an attack.
- **Code defect:** the perch sight ray started at his eye and could clip the rail or ledge he crouches on. Unverifiable from
  these logs; fixed anyway.

## Change
- Hunt start: 1–2 s on the perch, then he glides to where the bell told him she is (a point 1.5–3 m from her, 3–5 m if hidden,
  never the exact cupboard), lands and prowls. Line of sight under 14 m in the 80 deg cone gives the tell, then the dive (Mode 3),
  the crawl through service doors (Mode 7) and the grab at 1.05 m (Mode 6).
- At least one attack attempt per hunt: until he has dived, every 10 s he hears her again and searches near her.
- The sight ray skips its first 0.5 m.
- Log lines: `HC_COUNT_AI` once a second during a hunt (`state`, `pos`, `player`, `los`, `seen`, `dist`, `angle`, `hidden`,
  `torch`, `memory`, `route`, `attacked`, `why=`), plus `HC_COUNT_HEARD`, `HC_COUNT_SEARCH`, `HC_COUNT_ROUTE` (no route) and the
  existing `HC_COUNT_DIVE`.

## Integrator steps
Merge, rebuild the player (no Count import), re-run both scripted playthroughs and report the `HC_COUNT_*` lines. In the escape
run (hidden, torch off) expect `HC_COUNT_HEARD` at hunt start, `HC_COUNT_SEARCH` within 2 s and again every 10 s, and
`why=player hidden, torch off`. A run where she stays in the open should show `HC_COUNT_DIVE` within a few seconds of him
reaching line of sight.
